	"description": "This experimental plugin provides integration of Addressables on-demand texture loading for the spine-unity runtime.\nPlease be sure to test this package first and create backups of your project before using.\n\nUsage: First declare your target Material textures as addressable. Then select the SpineAtlasAsset, right-click the SpineAtlasAsset Inspector heading and select 'Add Addressables Loader'. This generates an 'AddressableTextureLoader' asset providing configuration parameters and sets up low-resolution placeholder textures which are automatically assigned in a pre-build step when building your game executable.\n\nPrerequisites:\nIt requires a working installation of the spine-unity runtime (via the spine-unity unitypackage), version 4.2.\n(See http://esotericsoftware.com/git/spine-runtimes/spine-unity)",
